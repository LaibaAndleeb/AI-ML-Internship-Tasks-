# Task 4 â€“ COVID-19 Dataset: Data Analysis & Visualization

##  Objective
To explore, analyze, and visualize worldwide COVID-19 trends using real-time data. This project aims to identify key patterns in confirmed, recovered, and death cases across countries and time.

##  Dataset
- **Source**: [COVID-19 Global Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasets/covid-19/main/data/countries-aggregated.csv)
- **File Used**: `covid19.csv`

##  Steps Performed
- Loaded and inspected the dataset
- Converted date column to datetime format
- Analyzed overall trends in confirmed, deaths, and recovered cases
- Identified top 10 countries with the most confirmed cases
- Calculated and displayed mortality and recovery rates

##  Visualizations
- Line plot: Worldwide trend of cases over time
- Bar chart: Top 10 countries by confirmed cases (latest date)

##  Key Insights
- Certain countries consistently reported the highest case counts
- Death and recovery rates vary widely by country
- Visual trends help understand waves and flattening of the curve

##  Tools & Libraries Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- pandas, seaborn, matplotlib

##  Conclusion
This analysis provides a clear overview of the global COVID-19 outbreak and helps extract meaningful patterns using simple yet powerful visual tools.
