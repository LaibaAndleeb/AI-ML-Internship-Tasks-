# Task 2 – Titanic Survival Prediction

## Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using logistic regression.

## Dataset
- Source: Titanic dataset from GitHub
- Features include: Age, Sex, Pclass, Fare, Embarked, etc.

## Machine Learning Model
- Logistic Regression (binary classification)

## Steps Performed
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Dropping irrelevant columns (Cabin, Ticket, Name)
- Encoding categorical variables (Sex, Embarked)
- Splitting data into training and test sets
- Model training and evaluation

## Results
- Accuracy Score: (e.g., 80% — write your real score here)
- Confusion Matrix and Classification Report generated

## Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook

## Conclusion
Successfully built a logistic regression model that predicts Titanic survival using basic preprocessing and classification techniques.
