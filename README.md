# DevelopersHub Internship â€“ AI/ML Engineering Tasks

Welcome! This repository contains my completed tasks for the AI/ML Engineering internship at DevelopersHub Corporation. I am Laiba Andleeb, As a Mechanical Engineering student with no prior experience in ML, this internship gave me an excellent opportunity to explore real-world datasets, learn Python, data preprocessing, machine learning, and data visualization using tools like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.


##  Tasks Completed

###  Task 2 â€“ Titanic Survival Prediction using Logistic Regression

**Objective**: Build a logistic regression model to predict if a Titanic passenger survived or not using features like age, class, sex, and fare.

**Tools Used**: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

**Key Steps**:
- Loaded Titanic dataset
- Dropped irrelevant columns
- Filled missing values
- Encoded categorical features (`Sex`, `Embarked`)
- Trained a logistic regression model
- Evaluated using accuracy score and classification report

###  Task 4 â€“ COVID-19 Dataset: Global Data Analysis

**Objective**: Analyze the worldwide COVID-19 situation using time-series data (confirmed, deaths, recovered) and visualize top-affected countries and trends.

**Tools Used**: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

**Key Steps**:
- Grouped data by date for global case trends
- Visualized global confirmed, recovered, and death cases over time
- Found top 10 affected countries
- Calculated mortality and recovery rates

###  Task 5 â€“ Netflix Dataset: Exploratory Data Analysis

**Objective**: Analyze Netflix content over time by type, genre, country, and duration trends.

**Tools Used**: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

**Key Steps**:
- Inspected dataset structure and handled missing values
- Compared Movies vs TV Shows count
- Analyzed release year distribution
- Found top-producing countries and popular genres
- Visualized average movie duration by year
